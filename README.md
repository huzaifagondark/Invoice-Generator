AUTOMATING MY BUSINESS WITH PYTHON: #2

PYTHON INVOICE GENERATOR USING TKINTER AND DOCXTPL:

In October 2023, when our repeated client list increased from 3 to 15 we wanted to give our brand a professional touch

for that, we came up with an invoice plan... every time a customer orders from us we'll send them an invoice generated by canva template

but the process was slow and time-consuming and was not at all aligned with our plan, this was before Python came into play

by using tkinter and docxtpl I've created an algorithm that takes the entries as shown in the post and generates an invoice 

align with the word template that I've chosen and use docxtpl module to visualize, analyze, and make the changes according to the entries

the main question is how is it different from the traditional canva template.

for starters, I've installed the calculation function inside my algorithm which means it will automatically calculate the total amount of the invoice

I can generate 15-20 invoices in less than a minute which in the case of canva took me around 10-20 minutes

the data is automatically stored in my Excel database for future...
